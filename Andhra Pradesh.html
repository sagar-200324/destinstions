    <li> Borra Caves, located in the Ananthagiri Hills of the Eastern Ghats near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, are one of India's largest and deepest natural caves. Formed by the erosive action of the Gosthani River over millions of years, these limestone caves are believed to be around 150 million years old. The caves are renowned for their stunning stalactite and stalagmite formations, with some resembling various shapes like a shivling, human brain, and animals, adding both geological and religious significance. Extending to a depth of 80 meters and covering approximately 2 kilometers, Borra Caves are a popular destination for tourists. The caves are illuminated with colorful lights, enhancing the visual appeal of the natural formations. A small Shiva Lingam inside the cave also makes it a place of religious importance for locals. Surrounded by the scenic beauty of Araku Valley, the caves offer an unforgettable experience of nature, history, and culture, making them a must-visit site. The best time to explore Borra Caves is during winter (October to February) or the monsoon season when the surrounding landscape is lush and vibrant.</li>
